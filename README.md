* Entered the Kaggle challenge to create a model that accurately predicts house prices via advanced regression techniques.
* Carried out initial Data Exploration and Data Cleansing to identify missing values. 
* Used mode replacement or n/a replacement to account for missing values within categorical features where applicable.
* Applied K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) regression to substitute missing values in numerical features.
* Completed feature transformation using techniques such as cosine transformation and one-hot encoding.
* Applied log transformation on the target variable to achieve normal distribution which was initially right skewed. (See below image)
* Selected xgboost regressor as the technique of choice to achieve a score of 0.14705.
